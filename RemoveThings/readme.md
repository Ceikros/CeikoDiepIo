Hello





















--Remove things
 - AdblockerForDiepIo [] Yes it does remove AdBanners! Does it remove AdVideos? Depends if advideos are inside the banners, Does this remove the "Advertisement" text above the ad banner? no. For the sake of not getting "Captchad/Recaptchad" I'm not gonna delete it (Im not sure if it affects the captcha though so just assuming it will cause me to captcha if i remove it)

 - RemoveDiscordPromoAndUpdateLogs [] it literally says it in the name IT removes The Join discord button that is located at the front view page and the update logs, you can check it in the top right menu anyways.
